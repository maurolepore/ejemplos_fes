## 3 A Review of the Predictive Modeling Process

http://www.feat.engineering/review-predictive-modeling-process.html

## Covers how to

* measure model performance

* use data well (e.g. splitting and resampling)

* tune models

* compare model performance

## Uses data

* OkCupid Profile Data

* Ames housing price

## OkCupid Profile Data

<https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid>

Goal: Predict whether a person's works in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

* 50 000 profiles in San Francisco, USA

* Most data is categorical.
    * They converted it to dummy variables.

* STEM workers are infrequent (18.5%).
    * They "down-sampled" to ensure each class (e.g. STEM) has equal number of profiles.
